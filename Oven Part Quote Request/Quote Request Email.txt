I would like to request a quote for a number of custom vacuum parts.
These parts are duplicates of parts which we have previously purchased
from you under quote number 04931 from back in August of 2004, though
we are not buying duplicates of all of the parts on that quote. The
person requesting the quote at the time was Jit Kee Chin, who has
since graduated from the group. I will repeat a description of the
parts here:

We require a custom non-standard knife edge. Standard conflat flanges
have a 0.026" distance between the plane of the tip of the knife edge
and the end plane of the flange ("recession"). However, for our
application, we require custom flanges that have 0.021" recession. I
have attached a drawing giving a depiction of what I mean.

*All the parts below must have the custom knife edge on unless
indicated otherwise.*

Quantity 2 of
90 degree 2.75" CFF elbow in 316SS, with rotatable flanges

Quantity 2 of
2.75" CFF tee in 316SS. Two flanges rotatable, one not. One of the
rotatable flanges is in the vertical leg of the tee, the other in the
horizontal span of the tee.

Quantity 4 of
2.75" CFF double sided blank in 316SS, 0.5" thick

Quantity 4 of
2.75" CFF half-nipple, capped, with non-rotatable flange, in 316SS.
The half-nipple should be terminated with a 0.25" thick SS plate, and
the welding should be done such that the 1.5" diameter of the tube is
not increased. See attached drawing.

Quantity 2 of
2.75" CFF to 4.5" CFF conical adapter in 316SS. The 4.5" end should
have a standard knife edge, the 2.75" end should have the custom knife
edge described above.
